Q. What are the main folders (Google and find out and list with partial contents on your system. Give brief descriptions for what you think they contain)?
bin, boot, dev, etc, home, lib, media, mnt, opt, proc, root, sbin, srv, sys, tmp

bin 	a place for most commonly used terminal commands, like ls, mount, rm, etc.
boot 	contains files needed to start up the system, including the Linux kernel, a RAM disk image and bootloader configuration files.
dev 	contains all device files, which are not regular files but instead refer to various hardware devices on the system, including hard 		drives.
etc 	contains system-global configuration files, which affect the system's behavior for all users.
home 	the place for users' home directories.
lib 	contains very important dynamic libraries and kernel modules
media 	a mount point for external devices, such as hard drives or removable media (floppies, CDs, DVDs).
mnt 	also a place for mount points, but dedicated specifically to "temporarily mounted" devices, such as network filesystems.
opt 	can be used to store addition software for your system, which is not handled by the package manager.
proc 	a virtual filesystem that provides a mechanism for kernel to send information to processes.
root 	the superuser's home directory, not in /home/ to allow for booting the system even if /home/ is not available.
sbin 	contains important administrative commands that should generally only be employed by the superuser.
srv 	can contain data directories of services such as HTTP (/srv/www/) or FTP.
sys 	a virtual filesystem that can be accessed to set or obtain information about the kernel's view of the system.
tmp 	a place for temporary files used by applications.
usr 	contains the majority of user utilities and applications, and partly replicates the root directory structure, containing for instance, 		among others, /usr/bin/ and /usr/lib.
var 	dedicated variable data that potentially changes rapidly; a notable directory it contains is /var/log where system log files are kept.

Q. What will you find in these folders
/etc
/etc/init.d
/var/log
/home
/home/<user-id>
/boot
/usr/bin

/etc 		files required to boot the system and communicate, and scripts to control the boot process
/etc/init.d 	internet service scripts run by init
/var/log 	system log files
/home 		user directories
/home/<user-id> files and folders inside user
/boot 		files needed to start up the system, including the Linux kernel, a RAM disk image and bootloader configuration files
/usr/bin 	system binary files

Q. What are environment variables? How do you display the value of an environment variable?

Environment variables are a set of dynamic named values that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer. They are part of the environment in which a process runs.

By using printenv command.

Q. What is $PATH? What is $HOME?

$PATH	When someone types a command to run, the system looks for it in the directories specified by PATH in the order specified.
$HOME	The location of the currently logged-in user's home directory.

Q. How do you change the $PATH. Why would you change $PATH?

By using export command.
$PATH is changed in order to look into more directories for any command, especially new user-built commands.

Q. How do you change $PATH so that it is set to include your changes every time you login? Create a bin directory in your $HOME folder and include that into the PATH so that every time you login the $HOME/bin is part of your PATH.

Add the PATH to /etc/bash.bashrc as root. Then use export commmand to change the path.


Q. If you are in the directory /a/b/c/d/e/f/g, what is the shortest command to switch directory to /a/b/c/d/e/h/k?

cd ../../h/k

Listing Directory
Q. List contents of your home directory
Q. List contents including hidden files. (What are hidden files?)
Q. List contents including file sizes and dates

ls
ls -a (hidden files start with .)
ls -l

Q. What are the folders in your root directory?

The root directory is the directory that contains all other directories and files on the system.

Moving Files
Q. How will you move a directory from one folder to another? What is command to move folder c at /a/b/c to /a/d/e/f directory?
Q. How do you split a large file into smaller files? How will you split a 10GB file into 10 1GB files?
Q. How do you put the file back together?

By using mv command. To move the folders along with its subdirectories, mv -f is to be used.
mv b/c d/e/f
split --bytes=1G filename newfilename
cat newfilename* > filename


Piping and Redirection
Q. Use |, >, >> with your commands and explain the results in your own words. 
1. | 
2. >
3. >>

|	passes output of one command to input of other command.
>	save output to a file.
>>	appends output to a file.

Q. Use the output of ls -l and create a new file with just the file sizes. Use the "cut" command. The whole operation can be done in one line. The fifth column is usually the size.

cut -d '  ' -f 5 > newfile

Q. What do these commands do
 
1. some_command >file.log 2>&1 
2. some_command 2>&1 | tee -a file.log

saves the stderr to the address of the stdout to file.log. Both standard error and standard output are being saved in the same location.
appends the stderr with stdout to file.log. It is piped through tee command, which not only redirects to the file, but also to standard output.

Q. What does "tee" do? How can I make the first one behave exactly like the 2nd?

tee copies standard input to file, and also to standard output.
By not using -a.

File Permissions
Q. Explain every field/column in the following listing
Daffy:ndvi sudhir$ ls -l
total 1752488
-rw-r--r--     1 sudhir  staff      68567 Nov 24  2014 alld1.txt
-rw-r--r--     1 sudhir  staff     279909 Nov 24  2014 alld2.txt
-rw-r--r--     1 sudhir  staff      68567 Nov 24  2014 alld3.txt
-rw-r--r--     1 sudhir  staff      56139 Nov 19  2014 districts.json
drwxr-xr-x  6217 sudhir  staff     211378 Nov 24  2014 pixel-maps
-rwxr-xr-x@    1 sudhir  staff  896793406 Nov 14  2014 water_mask_merged.tif

1st column gives detailed information regarding file permission, 
2nd column tells about the number of links to the file, 
3rd and 4th columns are associated with owner and group of the file, 
5th column displays the size of the file in bytes, 
6th column displays the recent time and date at which the file was modified, 
7th column is the actual file/directory name.

Q. What is sudo?

sudo is a command that allows users to run programs with the security privileges of the superuser, or root.

Q. How do you view the contents of /var/log/syslog. Give command to output last 5 lines of this file.

cat /var/log/syslog.
tail -5 /var/log/syslog.

Q. Create a new user in your system called "zteam" using the command line. Check out the options available for the command to create a user and list down options you'd use to create this account.

sudo adduser zteam

Q. Create a "zteam" folder in your home directory and give "ownnership" of the directory to zteam.

chown zteam zteam
